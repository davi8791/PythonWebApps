    "about_1": "Peter Benjamin Parker is a former high school student who gained spider-like abilities, fighting crime across New York City as the superhero Spider-Man. While Parker juggled all his continued hero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was approached by Tony Stark who recruited Spider-Man to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into the brief conflict with his personal hero, Captain America. Parker was given a new suit as well as new Stark technology in exchange for his help, allowing him to return back home to continue his own hero work.\n\nWhile he continued to try and prove himself as a worthy hero in the eyes of Iron Man so he could join the Avengers, Parker began investigating the illicit criminal activities of Vulture, who was attempting to sell his Chitauri based weapons onto the black market. Believing that capturing Vulture would prove his worth as a hero, Spider-Man had decided to go after Vulture alone, with only the assistance of his best friend Ned Leeds, while also trying to win his academic decathlon finals. Eventually, Parker gained the affections of fellow classmate Liz Allan, but learned her father, Adrian Toomes, was Vulture. Spider-Man thwarted Vulture's robbery of a Stark Industries cargo plane, to which Stark showed his respect by offering Parker an official place with the Avengers. Parker turned this down in order to continue being a small-time hero in New York, despite his Aunt May discovering his secret identity.\n\nParker was pulled back into the Avengers' conflict when the Black Order had invaded Earth, joining Stark as a stowaway to rescue Doctor Strange from space. Given a new Iron Spider armor, Parker, Stark and Strange joined forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, joining their attempts to prevent Thanos from collecting the six Infinity Stones. However, the heroes failed to defeat Thanos during the Battle of Titan, who later fulfilled his goal and initiated the Snap, killing Parker amongst trillions. Having been dead for five years, Spider-Man was resurrected in the Blip, and rejoined their fight against Thanos, ultimately watching Stark sacrifice his life to defeat the Mad Titan.",
    "about_2": "The bereaved and traumatized Parker decided to take some time off his hero duties, seeking refuge on his trip to Europe with all his classmates. However, despite wanting to focus his attention on winning the attention of Michelle Jones, Parker witnessed Hydro-Man's attack in Venice and was recruited by \"Nick Fury\" to work with Mysterio to defeat the Elementals. Dubbed Night Monkey after defeating Molten Man in Prague, Parker bequeathed Stark's glasses to Mysterio, only to discover that Mysterio manipulated him in doing so to gain access to Stark's weaponized drones to stage more threats. Recruiting Happy Hogan's help, Spider-Man traveled to London and defeated Mysterio, who died of a misfired gunshot on the Tower Bridge.\n\nUpon Parker's return to New York, doctored footage was sent to The Daily Bugle incriminating him instead as the mastermind of the drone attacks as well as the murderer of Mysterio, while exposing his true identity to the world in the process. While he was able to escape legal action with defense attorney Matt Murdock, the resulting controversy that upended his and his friends' futures led Parker to enlist Doctor Strange to cast a memory-wiping spell to make the identity of Spider-Man a secret once more. However, Parker's repeated amendments midcasting ruined the spell, resulting in a multiversal rift that unleashed foes of Spider-Man from alternate universes, including Doctor Octopus, Lizard, Electro, Sandman and Norman Osborn. Although intending to cure them before sending them back to avert their ill-fated deaths in their native universes, Osborn's Green Goblin alter convinced the villains to betray Parker, ultimately resulting in his aunt's death. Parker then met two alternate versions of himself who had also been transported alongside their villains to his universe and helped him overcome his grief and cure their enemies in the battle on the Statue of Liberty.\n\nFaced with an impossible choice, Parker had Strange cast another spell to make their universes oblivious to his existence in order to protect the Multiverse from collapsing, erasing himself from his friends and allies memories in his universe. Starting anew, Parker resumed his duties undisturbed as an independent Spider-Man.",
